    <div class="excerpt">
        Investing. Stocks. Shares. Equities. Bonds. ISAs. These are all terms that are banded about when it comes to personal finance and financial planning. But what do they actually mean? What is investing useful for? And how do you "start investing"?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24qYBiXaDDsSGgzBFxEe8SsECXiqVFpI">Lars Kroijer's fantastic 'Investing Demystified' series</a> on YouTube. 
This is simply a summary of what he talks about, with some insights specific to the UK.</p>

<h2>You can't beat the market</h2>

<p>When you're approaching investing as an individual, you need to take a step back and think about what you're up against.
There are thousands upon thousands of investment funds who are experts at this kind of thing, have access to the latest 
research, attend exclusive meetings and employ hundreds of analysts to look into every detail of a stock offering. </p>

<p>You have a smartphone, access to the internet, and that's about it. You can't compete on that level, and therefore you can't beat the market.
You might then ask, if these investment funds are so great, why not invest your money with them? You could, but after all
their fees, you're better off going down the DIY route. More on that later.</p>

<h2>Only buy passive global index trackers</h2>

<p>Hang about, we're getting into jargon again. Let's break down what this means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracker: a financial product that follows and tries to be representative of a market (a group of companies).</li>
<li>Index: a numerical measure of the performance of a market. You'll probably have heard of the FTSE100, this is an index
that measures the performance of the top 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange, when the FTSE is up, that means that
collectively across these companies their value is up, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Global: you probably know this one, but in this context it's a tracker that follows an index or multiple indices that 
encompass the entire global market.</li>
<li>Passive: decisions on how this fund allocates its share purchases are done based on being a representative sample of the index,
there is not an individual or individuals making investment decisions as there would be in an 'active' fund. As a result
passive funds are cheaper than active funds as they charge lower fees.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over a ten year period only 1 in 10 active funds will outperform passive trackers</p>
