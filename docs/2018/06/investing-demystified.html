    <div class="excerpt">
        Investing. Stocks. Shares. Equities. Bonds. ISAs. These are all terms that are banded about when it comes to personal finance and financial planning. But what do they actually mean? What is investing useful for? And how do you "start investing"?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24qYBiXaDDsSGgzBFxEe8SsECXiqVFpI">Lars Kroijer's fantastic 'Investing Demystified' series</a> on YouTube. 
This is simply a summary of what he talks about, with some insights specific to the UK.</p>

<h2>You can't beat the market</h2>

<p>When you're approaching investing as an individual, you need to take a step back and think about what you're up against.
There are thousands upon thousands of investment funds who are experts at this kind of thing, have access to the latest 
research, attend exclusive meetings and employ hundreds of analysts to look into every detail of a stock offering. As such,
the market price of any share can be seen to be a reflection of its true value based on all available information.</p>

<p>You have a smartphone, access to the internet, and that's about it. You can't compete on that level, you can't predict
the future value of any share better than the market and therefore you can't beat the market. You might then ask, 
if these investment funds are so great, why not invest your money with them? You could, but after all their fees, you're 
better off going down the DIY route. More on that later.</p>

<h2>Only buy passive global index trackers</h2>

<p>Hang about, we're getting into jargon again. Let's break down what this means:</p>

<h4>Tracker</h4>

<p>A financial product that follows and tries to be representative of a market, which may be a geographical region, or an
industry sector, or a number of other things.</p>

<h4>Index</h4>

<p>A numerical measure of the performance of a market. You'll probably have heard of the FTSE100, this is an index that 
measures the performance of the top 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange, when the FTSE is up, that means that
collectively across these companies their value is up, and vice versa.</p>

<h4>Global</h4>

<p>You probably know this one, but in this context it's a tracker that follows an index or multiple indices that encompass 
the entire global market. These tend to be funds that incorporate a number of indices, weighted on the market share of the index.</p>

<h4>Passive</h4>

<p>Decisions on how this fund allocates its share purchases are done based on being a representative sample of the index,
there is not an individual or individuals making investment decisions as there would be in an 'active' fund. As a result
passive funds are cheaper than active funds as they charge lower fees.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over a ten year period only 1 in 10 active funds will outperform passive trackers</p>
