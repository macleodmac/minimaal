        Investing seems tricky. It's a term that's banded about liberally when it comes to personal finance and  financial planning. But what does it actually mean? When is investing appropriate? And how do you "start investing"?

This is simply a summary of what he talks about, with some insights specific to the UK.</p>

<h2>You can't beat the market</h2>

<p>When you're approaching investing as an individual, you need to take a step back and think about what you're up against.
There are thousands upon thousands of investment funds who are experts at this kind of thing, have access to the latest 
research, attend exclusive meetings and employ hundreds of analysts to look into every detail of a stock offering. As such,
the market price of any share can be seen to be a reflection of its true value based on all available information.</p>

<p>You have a smartphone, access to the internet, and that's about it. You can't compete on that level, you can't predict
the future value of any share better than the market and therefore you can't beat the market. You might then ask, 
if these investment funds are so great, why not invest your money with them? You could, but after all their fees, you're 
better off going down the DIY route. More on that later.</p>

<h2>Only buy passive global index trackers</h2>

<p>Hang about, we're getting into jargon again. Let's break down what this means:</p>

<h4>Tracker</h4>

<p>A financial product that follows and tries to be representative of a market, which may be a geographical region, or an
industry sector, or a number of other things.</p>

<h4>Index</h4>

<p>A numerical measure of the performance of a market. You'll probably have heard of the FTSE100, this is an index that 
measures the performance of the top 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange, when the FTSE is up, that means that
collectively across these companies their value is up, and vice versa.</p>

<h4>Global</h4>

<p>You probably know this one, but in this context it's a tracker that follows an index or multiple indices that encompass 
the entire global market. These tend to be funds that incorporate a number of indices, weighted on the market share of 
the index. So if, for argument's sake the US and UK comprised 50% and 10% respectively of the global market share, 50% of 
your global tracker would be invested in an S&amp;P500 index tracker and 10% in the FTSE100. When you allocate a tracker based
on these metrics across the world it becomes globally diversified and therefore reduces your exposure to the risk associated
with a single share.</p>

<h4>Passive</h4>

<p>Decisions on how this fund allocates its share purchases are done based on being a representative sample of the index,
there is not an individual or individuals making investment decisions as there would be in an 'active' fund. As a result
passive funds are cheaper than active funds as they charge lower fees.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over a ten year period only 1 in 10 active funds will outperform passive trackers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Active funds can beat the markets, it's not impossible, however this is only true for about 10% of them on average. 
Active funds also usually have higher fees of 1.5-2%, which is the amount they take per year of the total money you invest.
Passive funds usually have fees of &lt;0.5%, which means therefore that the active funds have to outperform the passive funds
by a 1-1.5% to just be on par with them, let alone beat them.</p>

<p>This directly affects the amount of money in your investments - if you invest £10,000 for 30 years and achieve a return of
7% per year including inflation, with a passive tracker at 0.5% fees you will have £66,000 at the end of the 30 years. With
an active fund at 2% you will have just £43,000, a huge difference of £23,000.</p>

<h2>What will my returns be?</h2>

<p>No one can predict the future, but based on the past 200 years the stock markets tend to perform at 4-5% above inflation.
However this growth is not linear, when you're invested at a long-term horizon there will be some years when you are up 
much higher than this, and some years when you are down, even 'losing money'. This is why it's important to understand that
these kind of investments are only appropriate for the long-term, we're talking ideally 10+ years here. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you need that money for a house deposit at some point in the next five years it would not be wise to invest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Investing in such a way is only really designed for a long-term horizon, you don't want to be doing it as a short-term gain
as at the time you need to draw on the money and liquidate your investments, you could be down and have lost money. Over
the longer-term you will in all likelihood be up on your original investment, unless capitalism has failed and globally 
markets are consistently down, at which point we all have bigger things to worry about.</p>
